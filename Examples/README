MusKit Examples Readme - Created 12/15/09 by Adam Somers

This project contains several targets to demonstrate some of MusKit's features.
Set the active target to the example you want to try.


sig-gen: generates a sine wave at 440Hz

fm: generates a sine wave with vibrato

plucky: a polyphonic karplus-strong MIDI instrument.  Plucky will check for midi
devices and will automatically use one if you only have one connected.  If you 
have more than one connected, you will be shown a list of midi devices and 
prompted to select one.

You can also play plucky by typing on your computer's keyboard.  The chromatic 
scale is laid out as follows:

         w e   t y u
        a s d f g h j k

The numbers (1-9) select the octave.
